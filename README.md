Switchboard is a Nintendo-themed microblogging application written in Ruby and deployed using Sinatra.
Users can create an account, make posts, edit profile information, and view posts by other users as well as recent posts.

The profile icon color picker uses Jan Odv√°rko's <a href="http://jscolor.com/">jscolor</a> JavaScript component.
